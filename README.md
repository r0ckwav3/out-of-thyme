# Out of Thyme
This is a small game made in godot for the UCSB Game Development Club's winter 2024 quarterly project. It is a small cooking game that aims to keep you manically flipping between the recipe, your ingredients, and your giant pot.

## Running the Game
Currently, the only way to run this game is to install Godot v4.2.1 and launch it from there. I'll make production builds once it's closer to finishing
